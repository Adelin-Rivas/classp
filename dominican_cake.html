      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1¼ lb all purpose flour sifted (about 5 cups sifted) 640 g</li>
        <li>1¼ lb all purpose flour sifted (about 5 cups sifted) 640 g</li>
        <li>4 sticks of butter = 1 lb. (452 g)</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar (402 grams)</li>
        <li>10 large eggs (5 whole eggs / 5 yolks)</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk, or pineapple or orange juice (237 ml)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of vanilla extract or almond (15 ml)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of grated lemon zest (optional)</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 350 F. (175 C).</li>
        <li>Cream the butter on speed # 2 and add the sugar little by little. Move speed up to #4 and continue beating until butter mixture turns a pale yellow color and creamy texture. This may take about 10 minutes depending on what type of machine you use. I use a 5 quart KitchenAid.</li>
        <li> Pour the 5 egg yolks one at a time, beat well after each addition, and add the 5 whole eggs in the same way, one at at time. Beat for another 10 minutes or until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Start to add the mixture of flour and baking powder already sifted together (see note I, below) alternating with the mixture of milk and vanilla and ending with flour. Beat only until incorporated well (30 seconds is enough). If you decide to add the lemon zest, this is the time to add it.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into two round 11 x 2 or 10x 2 pans or two 10 x 10 square baking pans that are previously greased and bottom lined with wax paper. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. It’s ready when inserted tooth pick comes out clean. Let cool completely before placing on decorating dish, filling and decorating.</li>
      </ol>
