        <h1>Instructions</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Butter and flour a baking pan (3" height x 9" diameter [7.5 cm heigh x 22.5 cm diam]).</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 350 °F [175 °C].</li>
            <li>Using the wire whisk of your mixer beat the whites until they form peaks. Add half the sugar and beat until it is incorporated. Pour into a large bowl and reserve. Using the paddle attachment of your mixer beat butter and yolks for 3 minutes at medium high speed.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining sugar and beat until it is light and fluffy and has a very light yellow color (about 5 mins). Add vanilla extract then slowly add the flour and baking powder until it's well-mixed. Remove from the mixer.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 of the egg whites. Using a spatula, fold in the egg whites into the flour mix. Add the remaining white in two steps folding in each time with the spatula.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and it has a golden color on top (about 35 mins).</li>
            <li>Cool to room temperature before removing from the pan. Place on a lipped plate that can hold the milk sauce.</li>

            <h3>For garnishing:</h3>

            <li>Mix evaporated, skim and condensed milk. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Poke holes into the cake using a fork. Pour the milk mixture on top of the cake and let it soak in. Bathing it regularly until it has absorbed half of the liquid (one to two hours) keeping in the refrigerator all this time.</li>
            <li>Chill the mixer bowl and wire whisk before the next step.</li>
            <li>Beat the whipping cream over medium high speed until it starts to form peaks (about 3 mins).</li>
            <li>Add the powdered sugar and beat until it is mixed in, but careful not to overdo it or the cream will turn into butter.</li>
            <li>Spread the whipped cream on the chilled cake and decorate with strawberries or cherries.</li>
            <li>Chill for another 10 minutes before serving</li>
