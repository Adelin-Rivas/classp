                  <p class="menu-text">The idea for creating a cake soaked in a liquid is likely of Medieval European origin, as similar cakes,
                    such as British trifle and rum cake, and tiramisu from Italy, use this method.  Recipes for soaked-cake desserts
                    were seen in Mexico as early as the 19th century, likely a result of the large cross-cultural transfer which took
                    place between Europe and the Americas.  Recipes appeared on Nestl√© condensed milk can labels in the 1940s, which
                    may explain the cake's widely disseminated popularity throughout Latin America as the company had created subsidiaries
                    in Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela in the 1930s.The cake is popular in Central and South America,
                     North America and many parts of the Caribbean, Canary Islands, as well as in Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and some
                     other parts of Europe.

                  <p class="menu-text"> Habichuelas con dulce is a sweet bean liquid dessert from the Dominican Republic that is especially popular
                    around the Easter holiday.  The dessert is part of the cuisine of the Dominican Republic and is traditionally
                    garnished with milk cookies or with casabe, "a flatbread made of yuca flour."Habichuelas con dulce is made with
                    red beans, cinnamon, nutmeg, coconut milk, evaporated milk, raisins, butter, sugar and salt.  The beans are boiled
                    with salt and then blended to the consistency of soup. The coconut milk and evaporated milk are added along with cooked
                    sweet potato chunks.  Cloves and ginger can also be added as flavorings.

                    of the island of Hispaniola. The cake is characterized by its moist and airy texture and meringue frosting. It is
                    a popular fixture for special occasions, and is present at most events celebrated by Dominican families, including
                    anniversaries, baby showers, communions, and birthdays.The cakes can be found at many Dominican American bakeries
                    and are also a popular seller of many successful home businesses.
